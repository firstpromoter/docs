# Including fpr.js
 On your FirstPromoter dashboard, under the Settings> Integrations> Integrate your website section, based on the selections you make, you are provided with some scripts which are to be added to your website. 

 <Note>
 It is ideal that the script is added globally on the HEAD section of every marketing or public page of your website.
</Note>

```html
<script>(function(w){w.fpr=w.fpr||function(){w.fpr.q = w.fpr.q||[];w.fpr.q[arguments[0]=='set'?'unshift':'push'](arguments);};})(window);
fpr("init", {cid:"xxxxxxxx"}); 
fpr("click");
</script>
<script src="https://cdn.firstpromoter.com/fpr.js" async></script>
```

For JavaScript frameworks, you can simply insert the script on the public index.html page so it will be available when the framework loads.

For WordPress websites, you can add the scripts to your header.php file before the closing head tag.

To get the best performance, it is ideal that you have the scripts added to all the pages where you need tracking to take place. Also, the Scripts are loaded asynchronously and will not affect the website loading speed.


# Functions

## fpr("init",options, callback?)
This method initializes FirstPromoter with the provided options. Most of these options are loaded automatically when the script loads, but they can be overwritten by passing different ones to the method. The most used one is "ref_id" which forces the script to track a specific promoter.

<ParamField path="options" type="object" required>

## fpr("crossDomain",domains)

<ParamField path="domains" type="string|array">
    The crossDomain(s) you want to track
</ParamField>

### Example 

<CodeGroup>

fpr('crossDomain',['newwebsite.com', 'newwebsite1.com', 'newwebsite2.com'])
```
</CodeGroup>



## fpr("urlTracking")
This method is used for Direct URL tracking, thus, if you have landing pages for your affiliates/promoters, you can use the method on those pages if you don't want the affiliates/promoters "Referral ID" to be part of their referral links.

For this method to work, you will have to first add FirstPromoter's main tracking scripts to the landing page(s) and also enable "Direct URL tracking" on FirstPromoter. To do so, please check out this article: [How to enable direct URL tracking in FirstPromoter](https://help.firstpromoter.com/en/articles/8971394-how-to-enable-direct-url-tracking-in-firstpromoter)

<Note>Please note that the method  **should not** be used on your homepage, but instead should only be used on all landing pages of your affiliates/promoters.</Note>

```js
<script type="text/javascript">
_fprom=window._fprom||[];window._fprom=_fprom;_fprom.push(["url_tracking",true]);
if (window.$FPROM){$FPROM.trackVisitor({url_tracking: true})} else if(window.fpr) fpr("urlTracking");
</script>
```

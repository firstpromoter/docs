## Promoter
Promoters/Affiliates are individuals or companies who drive traffic to a companyâ€™s website, products, or services through referral links and earn a commission when that traffic converts.

## Referral 
A referral is an individual or business that signs up for or purchases a service using a referral link.

## Sale
A sale occurs when a customer makes a purchase using a referral link. We generate rewards or commissions only for sales.

## Referral Tracking
This refers to when the referral details (email address/UID) are sent to FirstPromoter from your website after they sign up or fill out a form. This can be done using the referral tracking script or API. 

## Sale Tracking
This refers to when payments are tracked from your billing provider, allowing commissions to be generated for your affiliates.

## ref_id
This is the referral id/token assigned to an affiliate/promoter once they signup or are added to a campaign. It is generated by FirstPromoter by default and can be set using our API as well. If a referral link is used it is set as a cookie `_fprom_ref` in your browser

## tid
This is a tracking ID that is dynamically generated by FirstPromoter when someone visits a referral link. This ID is set as a cookie called `_fprom_tid` in your browser.

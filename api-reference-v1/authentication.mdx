<Note>
  We suggest using our V2 API as it's more robust and comes with new improvements and features. 
</Note>


FirstPromoter uses an API key to authorize API requests. You can find your key on the Settings page of your FirstPromoter Dashboard  - login to FirstPromoter and click "Settings" button from the top bar.

FirstPromoter expects the API key to be included in all API requests to the server and must be placed in the header that looks like the following:
`X-API-KEY: {apikey}`

<Note>You must replace `{apikey}` with your account API key.</Note>

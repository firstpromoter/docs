Use this endpoint to create new promoters using the API. The response will return the newly added promoter as JSON.

Probably the most important value from the response is "auth_token", which is a unique key auto-generated on creation and can be used to automatically log in your promoters to their dashboard. Learn more

<Note>
 If this call is successful and you enabled "Promoter sign up accepted" emails for the campaign, it will start sending emails to the promoter. To skip the emails, set the skip_email_notification parameter to "true".

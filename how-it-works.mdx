## Setting Up a Campaign
Setting up a campaign with FirstPromoter is seamless and can be done in just a few clicks. During the onboarding process, you will create your first campaign. Each campaign generates a unique signup link that can be shared with your affiliates. When they sign up, FirstPromoter creates a unique referral link using the website URL you provide. Affiliates can then share this referral link with prospective customers.

## Click Tracking
Click tracking on FirstPromoter works after adding the main tracking script to your website. It works only once when a user visits a referral link by sending a `click` event to FirstPromoter.

## Referral Tracking.
Referral tracking occurs when a lead is captured on your website and sent to FirstPromoter after they sign up or fill out a form. This is achieved via the referral tracking script or API, which requires you to send the referral email address or UID to FirstPromoter. 

When a lead visits with a referral link, two cookies, `_fprom_tid` and `_fprom_ref`are set in their browser. These cookies have a default lifespan of 60 days (adjustable in the Admin panel) and are essential for the referral tracking script to function.

## Sales Tracking

Sales tracking is crucial for calculating commissions for affiliates. By default, FirstPromoter automatically tracks sales from providers like `Stripe`,`Chargebee`,`Braintree (subscriptions)`,`Recurly`, `Paddle` by listening to and cross-referencing events sent from the billing provider.
For other billing providers or custom setups, we provide an API to send sales events to FirstPromoter.

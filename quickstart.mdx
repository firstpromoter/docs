<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
     [Click here](https://new.firstpromoter.com/company/signup) to create an Admin account. If you already have an account, [Login here](https://login.firstpromoter.com/)

       <Note>
       If you are a new user, you will need to complete the onboarding process, which involves creating a campaign, connecting your billing provider, and integrating your website.
        </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Integrate your billing provider">
    Connect your billing provider to FirstPromoter. This will enable FirstPromoter to automatically track sales, refunds, upgrades or upsells and cancellations data/record from any of the [supported billing providers](/integrations/billing).<br/><Note>**NB:** For a billing provider that is not supported by default, there is an option to use our [API](/integrations/billing/api)</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate your website">
    Install or add our ready-made scripts/pixels to your website or [platform](/integrations/tracking/platform). We also provide [universal scripts and an API for custom-built websites or apps](/integrations/tracking/custom).
    <Tip>Integrating the tracking script into your website enables you to track clicks and referrals (thus, it allows you to send the lead's or referral's details such as the `email` or `uid` to FirstPromoter).<br/> 
    When combined with the billing provider integration, this setup enables FirstPromoter to track sales by linking referral information with transaction data from your billing provider. [Learn more about our tracking script here](/script-docs/fpr-js-docs)</Tip>
    <Note>
        You can also track sales using `Coupon Codes`. This option is available for users who want `No-Code` or `No-Scripts` integration or want an alternative to traditional referral links.

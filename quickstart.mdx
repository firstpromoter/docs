  <Step title="Integrate your billing provider">
    Connect your billing provider to FirstPromoter. This will enable FirstPromoter to automatically track sales, refunds, upgrades or upsells and cancellations data/record from any of the [supported billing providers](/integrations/billing).<br/><Note>**NB:** For a billing provider that is not supported by default, there is an option to use our [API](/integrations/billing/api)</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate your website">
    Install or add our ready-made scripts/pixels to your website's [platform supported](/integrations/tracking/platform). We also provide [universal scripts or API for custom built websites or apps](/integrations/tracking/custom). 
    <Tip>Integrating the tracking script into your website enables you to track clicks and referrals (thus, it allows you to send the lead's or referral's details such as the `email` or `uid` to FirstPromoter).<br/> 
    When combined with the billing provider integration, this setup enables FirstPromoter to track sales by linking referral information with transaction data from your billing provider.[Learn more about our tracking script here](/script-docs/fpr-js-docs)</Tip>
    <Note>
        You can also track sales using `Coupon Codes`. This option is available for users who want `No-Code` or `No-Scripts` integration or want an alternative to traditional referral links .

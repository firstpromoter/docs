# Receive FirstPromoter events in your webhook endpoint
Listen to events in your FirstPromoter account on your webhook endpoint so you can use them in your app.

## Why webhooks
After setting up your FirstPromoter account, you might want to receive events from FirstPromoter so as to run an action/activity or automate a process on your application. Webhooks allows you to do that.

To receive webhook events, you need to have an endpoint in your application that will accept the event. If you are using a tool Like Zapier, Albato or make.com  they provide these endpoints when creating an automation flow.

After you add the webhook to FirstPromoter, FirstPromoter can push real-time event data to your endpoint when events happen in your FirstPromoter account.

# Receive FirstPromoter events in your webhook endpoint
Listen to events in your FirstPromoter account on your webhook endpoint so you can use them in your app.

## Why webhooks
After setting up your FirstPromoter account, you may want to receive events from FirstPromoter in order to trigger an action or automate a process in your application. Webhooks allow you to do this.

To receive webhook events, you need to have an endpoint in your application that will accept the event. If you are using a tool like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), [Albato](https://albato.com/apps/firstpromoter) or [Make](https://www.make.com/en/integrations/firstpromoter)  they provide these endpoints when creating an automation flow.

 After you add the webhook to FirstPromoter, it can push real-time event data to your endpoint when events occur in your FirstPromoter account.

## How to set it up
Navigate to your Settings page > Select Integrations> Scroll down to the webhooks section.

You can also click [here]('https://login.firstpromoter.com?redirect=%settings%2Fintegrations') to go there directly.

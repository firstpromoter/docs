Our API allows you to track sales, refunds, upgrades and cancellations even if you have a billing provider we do not support.
<Note>
**Precondition**: 
<br/> You will need to set up an endpoint on your server for which you will receive webhook events from your billing provider.<br/> 
Once you are receiving webhook events on your server from your billing provider, you can then make a request to FirstPromoter to track sales when events are received.

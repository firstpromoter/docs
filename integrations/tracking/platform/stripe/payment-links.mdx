`Difficulty: Easy` <br/>
`Developer Required: No`


With FirstPromoter, you can setup click and signup/referral tracking using our `Stripe Payment Links` integration option. This setup mainly requires you to add/insert our ready made scripts into your website pages where you have buy/payment checkout links such as `https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxx`

<Note>
NB: If you are using your custom domain with stripe, you will need to change the link in the code that will be provided in your FirstPromoter dashboard from `https://buy.stripe.com/` to your checkout page's custom domain.

`Difficulty: Easy` <br/>
`Developer Required: No`


With FirstPromoter, you can setup click and signup/referral tracking using our `Stripe Pricing Table` integration option. This setup mainly requires you to add/insert our ready made scripts into your website pages where you have `<stripe-pricing-table></stripe-pricing-table>` html tag.

<Note>
To get the best results for tracking when using Stripe pricing tables, add the scripts to all pages where  `<stripe-pricing-table></stripe-pricing-table>` html tags are available.

## Authentication

### Obtaining Your Credentials

FirstPromoter uses two key credentials to authorize API requests:

1. **API Key**: A unique token that authenticates your application
2. **Account ID**: Identifies your specific FirstPromoter account

To locate these credentials:

1. Log in to your FirstPromoter Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Manage API Keys** → **Add new Key** if you don't have one already.
3. Set a descriptive key name (e.g., `My Application Key`) and click **Create** 
4. Immediately copy and securely store your newly generated API key.
5. You will find your **Account ID** in the same API integrations panel under **Settings** → **Integrations**

### Making Authenticated Requests

All API requests must include both credentials in your request headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_api_key}
ACCOUNT-ID: {your_account_id}
```

#### Example Request

```
GET https://v2.firstpromoter.com/api/v2/company/referrals
Authorization: Bearer 01234567890abcdef
ACCOUNT-ID: 123456
```

<Note>
  You must replace `{apikey}` with your account API key and  `{account_id}` with your account ID
</Note>

### Security Best Practices

- Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code
- Consider implementing IP restrictions for API access
- Regularly audit your API usage and rotate keys if suspicious activity occurs
- Use HTTPS for all API communications

### Rate Limits

To ensure fair usage and system stability, FirstPromoter implements the following rate limits:

- 400 requests per minute per account

Exceeding these limits will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

FirstPromoter uses an API key and the Account ID to authorize API requests. You can find your key on the Settings page of your FirstPromoter Dashboardâ€”log in to FirstPromoter and click the 'Settings' button in the top bar.

To make authenticated requests to our API, you'll need to include an Authorization header with a bearer token which will hold your API key as:
`Authorization: Bearer {apikey}`
and also the account ID as:
`ACCOUNT-ID: {account_id}`

You can find these in the settings > integrations section of your FirstPromoter dashboard

<Note>You must replace `{apikey}` with your account API key and  `{account_id}` with your account ID</Note>
